                        She grew up experiencing significant trauma and eventually went down a path of drug addiction and deep emotional wounds. She later found healing and hope through her faith in God and now leads Straight Out of Darkness Ministry, where she shares her story to inspire others on their own journey of recovery from addiction and trauma.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Michelle faced many challenges at home due to her parentsâ€™ struggles with addiction, alcoholism, domestic violence, and mental health issues. Despite the abuse, she persevered with resilience and found restoration through her faith. She is now actively involved in Straight Out of Darkness Recovery Ministry and desires to be a voice for those struggling with mental illness, addiction, domestic violence, and homelessness.
